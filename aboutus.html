        <p>Steven Rothman with his brother Dr. M. J. Rothman, are the inventors of Florence A. Rothman Patient Monitoring Index (named in honor of their mother), which has vastly improved continuity of care and helped prevent medical errors in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient practices. The&nbsp;<a href="http://giftforwhendoccanfitintoxl121.vpweb.com/research" id="6CB9EF8F-980F-4C86-B823-C2E79C4811B1">Rothman Index</a>&nbsp;has been published in peer-reviewed medical journals and is being implemented commercially by PeraHealth, Inc. (Charlotte, NC) and Alive Sciences, LLC (Sarasota, FL).</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>Rothman has also achieved prominence within the oil and gas industry, developing new, high-tech methods of exploration for the two companies he co-founded—Bravo Resources, Inc. in New Mexico, and the Denver-based Zavanna, LLC. Previously, Rothman worked as an analyst and consultant for several high-level U.S. government and military programs. As a member of MITRE, a “think tank” created by MIT, he provided onsite systems analysis to NASA, NORAD, USAF and ERDA (Energy Research and Development Administration).&nbsp;</p>

        <p><br>
          Alan Solinger joined FARI in 2012 and contributed greatly, successfully completing and 
          publishing breakthrough research. His publications and presentations while at FARI are 
          listed below.<br>
          Alan was born in Chicago August 2, 1941, and died in Sarasota May 7, 2017. He raised three children and was a deep friend to so many - he is sorely missed. He loved life, learning, creativity, people and food. He added to our knowledge of physics and astronomy.<br>
          Graduating high school at 16, grad school at 21, he received a doctorate in Astrophysics from U. Of Michigan. His thesis: in the explosion of Galaxy M82, the exact nature of polarization radiation occurred by reflection, not by syncretism. At MIT he taught physics, wrote papers and in 1972 had his most spectacular discovery which is still quoted today: luminosity is directly related to the speed of clusters of galaxies.<br>
          He lectured at the prestigious University of Manchester in England for a year and travelled widely in Europe. He returned to Europe at every opportunity for the remainder of his life.</p>
