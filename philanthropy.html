		<h3 class="text-center">Be a part of something special</h3>
		<p class="text-center">We are all proud of Sarasota’s arts, beaches, weather, medical services, educational organizations and biotechnology industry but are you aware of a breakthrough in healthcare information technology invented at Sarasota Memorial that is making a difference around the world?</p>
		<div class="phil_section">
			<p class="phil_text">In 2003, while I was CEO at Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Florence A. Rothman died three weeks after “successful” open heart surgery.  We worked with her sons, Steven and Michael, who utilized cutting edge “big data” analytics and their unique genius to create the Rothman Index (Ri), a breakthrough in health information technology, to keep this from happening to others. They discovered that there is a wealth of data stored in electronic medical records but very little information of use to caregivers.  Michael Rothman described the electronic record as a giant filing cabinet into which no one ever looked.  The impact of that work was the saving of thousands of lives in hospitals using the Ri across the nation. PeraHealth, Inc. is now working with hospitals across the United States to spread this technology and Alive Sciences, located in Sarasota, is working with nursing homes, home health agencies and even independent living organizations across the US and around the world with customers in China, Spain, Italy, Lithuania and Ireland.</p>

			<p class="phil_text">You can be a part of the Florence A. Rothman Institute (FARI) that we created to apply that kind of innovative analysis and unique expertise to improve healthcare delivery. We are a small, flexible, uniquely qualified team with extensive experience in healthcare delivery, healthcare research and data science as well as strong local alliances to the Sarasota Memorial Healthcare System and the New College of Florida Data Science program. Because we are here in Sarasota we can provide access to our scientists and the ability of our donors to contribute their ideas, experience and knowledge to help up improve the quality of life for patients all over the globe.</p>

			<p class="phil_text">Why Sarasota?  Sarasota is a special place with its demographics of an older population that has been living here for long periods and the fact that SMH was an early adopter of the electronic medical record with over 18 years of data.</p>

			<p class="phil_text">Our current projects utilize the techniques developed by Steven and Michael Rothman and vary from exploring a new way of identifying patients with Alzheimer’s Disease before the onset of symptoms, establishing new reference limits for common laboratory tests, improving the Rothman Index, and reducing hospital readmissions to finding unique patterns in patients with multiple chronic diseases (particularly appropriate to our demographics).</p>

			<p class="phil_text">FARI has been granted 501c3 status and is dependent upon grants, contracts with outside firms for data analysis and donations from individuals and trusts.  Our expenses are an open book and over 95% go to salaries to support our scientists.</p><br>
