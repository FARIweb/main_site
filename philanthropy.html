		<h3 class="text-center">Be part of something special in Sarasota</h3>
		<p class="text-center">"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." – Margaret Mead</p>
		<div class="phil_section">
			<p class="phil_text">We are all proud of Sarasota’s arts, beaches, weather, medical services, educational organizations and biotechnology industry but are you aware of a breakthrough in healthcare information technology invented at Sarasota Memorial that is making a difference around the world?</p>

			<p class="phil_text">Today, you can be a part of the Florence A. Rothman Institute (FARI), which was created to apply a kind of innovative analysis and unique expertise to improve healthcare delivery. We are a small, flexible, uniquely qualified team with extensive experience in healthcare delivery, healthcare research and data science along with some strong local alliances to the Sarasota Memorial Healthcare System and the New College of Florida Data Science program. Because we are here in Sarasota, we can provide access to our scientists and the ability of our donors to contribute their ideas, experience and knowledge to help up improve the quality of life for patients all over the globe.</p>

			<br><h4>Our History</h4>
			<p class="phil_text">In 2003, while I was CEO at Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Florence A. Rothman died three weeks after “successful” open heart surgery.  We worked with her sons, Steven and Michael, who utilized cutting edge “big data” analytics and their unique genius to create the Rothman Index (Ri), a breakthrough in health information technology, to keep this from happening to others. They discovered that there is a wealth of data stored in electronic medical records but very little information of use to caregivers.</p>

			<br><h4>Saving Thousands of Lives</h4>
			<p class="phil_text">Michael Rothman described the electronic record as a giant filing cabinet into which no one ever looked.  The impact of that work was the saving of thousands of lives in hospitals using the Ri across the nation. PeraHealth, Inc. is now working with hospitals across the United States to spread this technology.  Alive Sciences, located in Sarasota, is working with nursing homes, home health agencies and even independent living organizations across the US and around the world with customers in China, Spain, Italy, Lithuania and Ireland.</p>

			<br><h4>Why Sarasota?  </h4>
			<p class="phil_text">Sarasota is a special place with its demographics of an older population living here for long periods. SMH was an early adopter of the electronic medical record and has over 18 years of data.</p>

			<br><h4>Support Our Current Projects</h4>
			<p class="phil_text">Our current projects utilize the techniques developed by Steven and Michael Rothman and vary from exploring a new way of identifying patients with Alzheimer’s Disease before the onset of symptoms, establishing new reference limits for common laboratory tests, improving the Rothman Index, and reducing hospital readmissions to finding unique patterns in patients with multiple chronic diseases (particularly appropriate to our demographics).</p>

			<p class="phil_text">The Florence A. Rothman Institute is seeking funding from various resources that wish to become a part of this ground breaking new medical research.  We seek grants, contracts or partnerships with other firms for data analysis and donations from Individuals, Trusts, businesses and foundations. At FARI over 90% of expenses are attributable to program activities.  Please visit our website at www.farinstitute.org for more information. </p>

			<p class="phil_text">FARI is a non-profit Florida corporation designated by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) entitling the donor to deduct any contributions to the fullest extent of the law. FARI is also registered with the Florida Department of Agriculture, Division of Consumer Services, for Charitable Solicitations allowing the organization to solicit contributions within the State of Florida. A copy of the official registration and financial information may be obtained from the Division of Consumer Services by calling toll free (within the State of FL) 1-800-HELP-FLA (435-7352) or 1-850-410-3800 if calling from outside of Florida or visiting the Division’s website at www.800helpfla.com.</p>
